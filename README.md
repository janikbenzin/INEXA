# INEXA

INEXA is a method for interactive, explainable process model abstraction.

## Getting started

The file run_real_world.py includes the script to apply INEXA on the real-world dataset at [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/7958478).
The file running_example.py includes the script to apply INEXA to the running example dataset (based on [1]) that is included in the repository.
The file inexa.py includes all functions required by INEXA.
